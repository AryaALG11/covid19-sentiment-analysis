# Overview
This project performs a detailed sentiment analysis of tweets related to Covid-19 vaccines using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The analysis aims to understand public sentiment towards different vaccines over time, identify common words and trends in highly positive and negative tweets, and visualize sentiment distribution across various dimensions such as time, keywords, and seasonal patterns.

# Features
Sentiment Analysis: Leverages the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) tool to classify tweets into positive, neutral, and negative sentiments.
Data Cleaning: Preprocesses tweets by removing handles, hashtags, URLs, special characters, and extra spaces to ensure clean and relevant text data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Utilizes various visualizations to explore the distribution of sentiments and identify patterns.
Keyword Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes sentiments based on specific keywords related to Covid-19 vaccines (e.g., 'Pfizer', 'Moderna', 'vaccine', 'covid', 'AstraZeneca').
Time Series Analysis: Investigates sentiment trends over time and performs seasonal decomposition of the sentiment data.
Word Cloud Visualization: Generates word clouds to highlight the most common words in the most positive and negative tweets.
